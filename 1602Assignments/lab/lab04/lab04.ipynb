    "\n",
    "For operations like arithmetic, or the functions in the NumPy library, you don't need to use `apply`, because they automatically work on each element of an array.  But there are many things that don't.  The string manipulation we did in today's lab is one example.  Since you can write any code you want in a function, `apply` gives you total control over how you operate on data."

    "Check out the `% Change` column in `compensation`.  It shows the percentage increase in the CEO's pay from the previous year.  For CEOs with no previous year on record, it instead says \"(No previous year)\".  The values in this column are *strings*, not numbers, so like the `Total Pay` column, it's not usable without a bit of extra work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your current pay and the percentage increase from the previous year, you can compute your previous year's pay.  For example, if your pay is $\\$120$ this year, and that's an increase of 50% from the previous year, then your previous year's pay was $\\frac{\\$120}{1 + \\frac{50}{100}}$, or \\$80.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3.5** Create a new table called `with_previous_compensation`.  It should be a copy of `compensation`, but with the \"(No previous year)\" CEOs filtered out, and with an extra column called `2014 Total Pay ($)`.  That column should have each CEO's pay in 2014.\n",
